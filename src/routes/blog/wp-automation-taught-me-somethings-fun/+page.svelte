        <p>
            I mean automating couple of hundreds of messages is not that big of
            a deal. But I was curious to see how it goes. Regardless it was a
            decent learning experience. That taught me many things.

            <p>
                I one day received a request from a friend asking me to help
                them send 350+ messages individually in whatsapp. I without
                having a second thought said yes and starting working on this
                seemingly simple task. That is where the journey began.

                I never planned to release this blog in the first place. I did
                encounter some new and interesting finding which I wanted to
                share. I tried sharing in Linkedin but quickly hit the
                <code>max message</code> limit. So, after asking and thinking about
                the pro plan. I came to conclusion setting a blog is a good idea.

                I have actually open sourced the code on github. If you are
                curious then you can check it here.
