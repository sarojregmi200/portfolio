                I was working on a project where I needed to automate some
                Whatsapp Messages. I had a list of messages that I wanted to
                send, and I wanted to make sure that I didn't send the same
                message twice. I also wanted to make sure that I didn't send the
                same message to the same person twice.
            </p>
